## Hello!

My name is Sam Eigen. I graduated from Tulane University with a double major in Political Economy and Computer Science in May of 2020! Ever since then (COVID!) I've been stuck in my room going nuts! How nuts you may ask?

In the span of this past year, I have:

- Learned how to develop, deploy, and manage a full-stack iOS application w/ a super fun and collaborative AGILE team
- Became one of those annoying Vim people (sorry VSCode)
- Received all certifications in a major SIEM - shoutout Sumo Logic!
- Happily joined the PC Master Race. Building a PC is the way to go!
- Deployed a Flask REST API using AWS Lambda into S3, DynamoDB, RDS, SES, etc.
