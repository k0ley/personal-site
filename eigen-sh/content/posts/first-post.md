## Hello!
Before going any further, please take a look at the [ABOUT](https://eigen.sh/about) section to learn a bit about me!

Welcome to eigen.sh - this is essentially my spot to play around with new technology and not feel bad about it by by using cloud hosted infrastructure. This site is hosted on GitHub pages and I directly push code and updates through there. [Super easy if you want to build something fast and clean](https://pages.github.com/).

The point of this website is to make all of my personal (and some professional) projects available to the world! In the future I plan on building an ADA staking pool from scratch, so keep an eye out :)
